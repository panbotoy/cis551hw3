Files:
src folder: not needed for compilation with makefile
ServerJar.jar
makefile
Proposal: describes the structure of our chatting system and the security concepts that we cover with our system.

Compiling and running our code:
1. We have a make file. Please make sure makefile, ServerJar.jar, ChatServer.java, ChatClient.java are in the same directory.
2. Run the make file. ChatServer.class, ChatClient.class should be compiled respectively.

3. Running the server side code, please use the following command:
    java -cp .:ServerJar.jar ChatServer

4. Running the client side code, please use the following command:
    java -cp .:ServerJar.jar ChatClient <Server Host Name>
If you are running on the same machine for server and client, <Server Host Name > should be localhost. Or it can be specXX which the server runs on.

5. When the client connects to server, server should prompt to ask the client to login, the only user name we stored on the server side is: 
                    user 123
Please input this string (separated by a space) to log in.

6. The client can start to chat. Server side user can also send information.

7. The client can type ¡°exit¡± as an exit message to terminate the connection.
